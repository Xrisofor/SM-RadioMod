* Activate the mod in the game world

## Available objects
* Custom Radio
* Mini Custom Radio
* Portable Radio
* Radio Speaker
* Radio Remote Control
* Device Timer (works only in worlds where time flows)

* **Compatibility:** Minimal conflicts with other mods that may use different versions of the bank files.
